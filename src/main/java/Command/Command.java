 * The `Command` abstract class represents a base class for various commands in the Duke application.

 * The `execute` method defines the behavior of the command, and the `isExit` method indicates whether
 * the command should exit the application.
 * This abstract class ensures that all command classes share a common interface for execution and exit status.
