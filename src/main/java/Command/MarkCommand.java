 * The `MarkCommand` class represents a command to mark a task as completed in the Duke application.
 * It extends the `Command` class and is responsible for updating the status of a specified task to "done."
 * This class encapsulates the behavior of marking a task as completed and saving the updated task list to storage.
 * It also performs validation to ensure that the specified task index is valid and that the task is
 * not already marked as done.
 * If the specified task index is out of range or the task is already marked as done, an exception is thrown.
