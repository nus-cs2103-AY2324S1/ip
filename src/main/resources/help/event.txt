THE "event" COMMAND:

Creates a time sensitive event with a specified
start and end datetime.

HOW TO USE:
"event <description> /from <datetime> /to <datetime>" - creates an event task with description, "from" date time and a "to" date time specified.

General rules for date time format:
1. If "/from" or "/to" has a time, both must have a time.
2. If "/to" must be after "/from".
3. Only date input will not include a time saved in the task.
4. Only time input will set a date with reference to the `/to` time and give the next occurence of that duraiton.
5. For `time` to `date, time`  input, the inferred date for `/from` will be the next occurence of that time instead of referencing the `/to` time.

For accepted date time formats, type "help datetime" to see all accepted date time formats
