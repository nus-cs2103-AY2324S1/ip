Hey seems like you need some help!

I am Oreo, your trusty canine friend :D
I can help you keep track of your tasks!

Here are some things you can do:

help - displays this message again
help <command> - learn more about a <command> âœ¦
todo - creates a todo task
deadline - creates a deadline task
event - creates an event task
list - list all task you have created
mark - marks task as done
unmark - unmarks task as incomplete
delete - deletes a task/deletes all task
clear - deletes all task
edit/modify/update - modifies a task
find - searches for a task
save - saves the current tasks to file
bye - exits the application

Try "help datetime" for accepted datetime formats.

Try creating a task now! Type "todo play with oreo" or try "help <command>" to learn more about a specific command (e.g. "help todo").
