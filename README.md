Named after the legendary F1 driver Max Verstappen, and just like him, this is undoubtedly the best at what it's supposed to do.

Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
3. After that, locate the `src/main/java/duke.Launcher.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run duke.Launcher.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see a GUI pop out!

Have fun using Max - The Goated Bot
