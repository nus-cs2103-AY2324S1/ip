# Sidtacphi
>    “The small ditetrahedronary cubiprismatohecatonicosachoron, or sidtacphi, is a nonconvex [uniform polychoron](https://polytope.miraheze.org/wiki/Uniform_polytope#4D) that consists of 600 [cubes](https://polytope.miraheze.org/wiki/Cube) (lying in the same hyperplanes, forming 120 [compounds of five cubes](https://polytope.miraheze.org/wiki/Rhombihedron)), 120 [dodecahedra](https://polytope.miraheze.org/wiki/Dodecahedron), and 720 [pentagonal prisms](https://polytope.miraheze.org/wiki/Pentagonal_prism). Eight cubes (or four compounds), four dodecahedra, and twelve pentagonal prisms join at each vertex.” – [Miraheze](https://polytope.miraheze.org/wiki/Small_ditetrahedronary_cubiprismatohecatonicosachoron)
