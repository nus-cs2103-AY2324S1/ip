## Project Description
This is my project, created from a template for a greenfield Java project.
It's named after the Java mascot _Duke_.
This project is a Java application that aims to provide a user-friendly task management system. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently and keep track of their schedules.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Users can add various types of tasks, including todo, deadline, and event tasks.
- **Task List**: View a list of all tasks, including their descriptions and completion status.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete when they are done.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Task Searching**: Search for tasks based on keywords.
- **Data Storage**: Data is automatically saved and loaded for seamless usage.

## Installation Option 1

1. Go to tjingsheng ip [releases](https://github.com/tjingsheng/ip/releases)
2. **Get Java**: Ensure you have a functioning version of Java.
3. **Copy the JAR File**: Copy the JAR file you want to run into an empty folder.
4. **Open a Command Window**: Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) in the same folder where you copied the JAR file.
5. **Run the Command**: Use the following command to run the JAR file:
6. **Enjoy**: Duke is very fun.

    public static void runDuke() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Ui.helloWorld();
        boolean isConversing = true;
        while (isConversing) {
            String rawCommand = Ui.getUserInput(scanner);
            TaskList taskList = TaskFileHandler.readFromFile();
            Ui.getBotMessage();
            Command command = Parser.parse(rawCommand);
            command.execute(taskList);
            TaskFileHandler.saveToFile(taskList);
            isConversing = !command.isByeCommand();
