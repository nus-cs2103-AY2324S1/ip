# Robert - Your Personal Assistant

This is a greenfield Java project. It's named after my best friend _Robert_.

Robert is an application designed for efficient task, deadline, and event management.
It also offers functionality to mark and filter activities that are tracked by the application.
If you are a fast typer, Robert can accomplish tracking tasks faster than traditional GUI applications.
