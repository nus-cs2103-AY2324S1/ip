## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
3. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:

## Features
### Notes about command format
1. Items in ```UPPER_CASE``` are parameters to be supplied by the user.
   e.g. in ```todo TASK_DESCRIPTION```, ```TASK_DESCRIPTION``` is a parameter which can be used as todo homework.
2. Items in square brackets are optional.
   e.g. ```deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION /by DATE [TIME]``` can be used as ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by 7/11/2023``` or ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by 7/11/2023 1500```
3. All ```DATE``` parameters can be put in multiple formats.
   e.g. ```deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION /by DATE [TIME]``` can be used as ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by 2023-09-08```, ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by 8/9/2023``` or  ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by Mon```
4. All weekday abbreviations in ```DATE``` parameters refers to the coming weekday
   e.g. ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by Mon``` refers to next Monday.
5. All ```[TIME]``` parameters can be put as either in 12-Hour clock format or 24-Hour clock format.
   e.g. ```deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION /by DATE [TIME]``` can be used as ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by Mon 11.59pm```,      
   ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by Mon 2359``` or ```deadline IS1108 Assignment /by Mon 23:59```
6. Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as ```list``` and ```clear```) will be ignored.
   e.g. if the command specifies ```list 123```, it will be interpreted as ```list```.
