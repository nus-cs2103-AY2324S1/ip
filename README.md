# **Alpha**

Alpha is a Chatbot I made with my very limited programming skills. It currently is: 

- Purely text-based
- Probably disappointed at how poorly I made it
- ~~Functional~~ Usable

Here's how I developed Alpha:
1. Bid for CS2103T
2. Appeal for CS2103T
3. Spend like a solid 10 hours weekly constantly changing the code
4. And it is finally **done**. (Until next week :sob:)

Features include:
- [x] These fancy checkbox thingies that you cannot click on. 

You can go [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/ip) to view Alpha's predecessor (even though Alpha should really be the first). 

The code I am proudest of in Alpha:
```
private static String TODO = "todo";
```

And, last but not least:

> "Bye." - Chatbot Alpha
