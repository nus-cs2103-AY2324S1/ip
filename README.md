# PHI :dragon_face: :rowboat:
>"Coding is a mental construct, just think more computing thoughts" - Me


*PHI* frees your mind of having to remember things you need to do. It's
- text-based
- easy to figure out
- encapsulates the very human touch of having somebody exasperated with your improper user inputs.

All you need to do is:
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/phiphi-tan/ip/releases)
2. Run the .jar file
3. Do your stuff and watch it manage your tasks for you

Best part of all, it is completely **FREE** (~~unlike its creator's schedule~~)!

Look at all the things it can do:
- [x] Managing to-do items
- [x] Managing tasks with deadlines
- [x] Managing events
- [x] Search feature for keywords
- [x] Mock you if you fail to give proper inputs
- [ ] Reminders (that's a lie, I'm not doing that)

Since you're still here, here's a chunk of code for you to test out your coding abilities:
   ```java
   /*
   Welcome to
    ___ _  _ ___
   | _ \ || |_ _|
   |  _/ __ || | 
   |_| |_||_|___|
   PHI (Programmable Human Interface)
   */
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You are a nerd");
    }  
}
```
