Some of the characteristics of these are as follows:

### Edit and update tasks
When you've completed a task, you can **mark** it as done! Other ways of editing your list of fabulous todos include
**deleting** and **unmarking** a task as done.

### Find tasks

we want to help you get back on track! You may find tasks with a keyword, or list out all your tasks!
