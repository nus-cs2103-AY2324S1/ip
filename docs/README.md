# TaskMate - Your Personal Task-Tracking Assistant

# User Guide

TaskMate is a desktop application designed for task management, ideally utilized through a Command-Line Interface (CLI),
all the while retaining the advantages of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is recommended to follow along with the
commands in this guide in a step-by-step manner as the expected output assumes you have been following the commands
sequentially.

## Downloading TaskMate

You may choose the release version of TaskMate from [this link](https://github.com/elhy1999/ip/releases). Please
download the `taskmate.jar` file **into a clean folder**. Next, run the `.jar` file either by double-clicking on the
application, or running `java -jar taskmate.jar` in your terminal.

Note: A new `data/` folder will be created in the directory where you installed TaskMate. This folder contains your task
data so that when you exit the application, your data is saved locally.

## Features

### Add Task

TaskMate supports adding three different categories of tasks:
1. todo: A task without any date/time attached to it (e.g., learn HTML/CSS one day)
2. deadline: A task that needs to be done before a specific date/time (e.g., purchase anniversary gift by 2023-09-19)
3. event: A task that start at a specific date/time and ends at a specific date/time
   (e.g., learning journey 2023-09-23 to 2023-09-24)

### Delete Task

TaskMate permits you to delete tasks from your task-list that you no longer wish to keep.

### Listing All Tasks

TaskMate enables you to list down the tasks in your task-list, along with accompanying information
indicating whether each task has been completed or not.

### Finding Tasks

TaskMate enables you to find tasks within your task list by using keywords / keyphrases found in the tasks' names
or dates.

### Mark & Unmark Tasks

TaskMate offers the capability to mark tasks in your task-list as completed, and subsequently, if desired, to revert
(unmark) them back to an incomplete status.

### Updating Tasks

TaskMate allows you to change (update) information about existing tasks in your task-list.

### Call for "help"!!!

In case you've forgotten the syntax of available commands, simply call for help, and TaskMate will provide a detailed
list of each command along with its corresponding syntax.

### Saving your data
When you close TaskMate using the `bye` command, TaskMate automatically saves your task data onto your computer so that
when you boot TaskMate up again in the future, this data will be loaded and you will not need to retype all your tasks
from scratch.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

TaskMate has a GUI which offers a more aesthetically pleasing experience. It is able to provide you with information
about the name of each task, the index of each task, any dates associated to it (usually in brackets next to the task's
name), the type of the task (i.e. todo, deadline, or event), as well as whether it has been completed. Take the
following as an example:

```
1.[T][ ] learn HTML/CSS one day
2.[D][ ] purchase anniversary gift (by: Sep 19 2023)
3.[E][X] learning journey (from: Sep 23 2023 to: Sep 24 2023)
```

In the example above, we see the index of each task on the left. Next to the index, we see the task type in squared
brackets (i.e. `[T]`, `[D]`, and `[E]` representing *todo*, *deadline*, and *event* respectively). Next to that, we see
another set of squared brackets indicating if the task has been marked as completed or not (an `X` indicates that it
has been completed). To the right of this indicator, we see the task name. For *deadline* and *event* tasks, there are
also dates associated to each task, which are in round brackets to the right of the task name.


## Usage

### `todo` - Add a *todo* task to your task-list

This command creates a *todo* task for you and adds it to your task-list. Note that a *todo* task is a task **without
any dates** associated to it.

`<name>`: The name of the *todo* task

#### Example of usage: 

`todo learn HTML/CSS one day`

Now you have 1 task(s) in the list.
```

### `deadline` - Add a *deadline* task to your task-list

This command creates a *deadline* task for you and adds it to your task-list. Note that a *deadline* task is a task that
has a date representing a deadline attached to it. This date must be in the "YYYY-mm-dd" format.

#### **Syntax**: `deadline <name> /by: <by>`

`<name>`: The name of the *deadline* task

`<by>`: A datetime representing **by when** does the task have to be completed. This datetime has to be in the

### `event` - Add an *event* task to your task-list

This command creates a *event* task for you and adds it to your task-list. Note that an *event* task is a task that
has two dates representing the start-date and the end-date attached to it. These dates must be in the "YYYY-mm-dd"
format.

#### **Syntax**: `event <name> /from: <from> /to <to>`

`<name>`: The name of the *deadline* task

`<from>`: A datetime representing the date which the event **starts from**. This datetime has to be in the YYYY-mm-dd
format

`<to>`: A datetime representing the date which the event **lasts to**. This datetime has to be in the YYYY-mm-dd format

view the index of the task you wish to mark, use the `list` command. (See also: `list`)

#### Example of usage (1):

### `unmark` - label a task in your task-list as incomplete

This command removes the label 'X' next to your task (if it exists. Otherwise, this command does nothing).

#### **Syntax**: `unmark <index>`

`<index>`: An integer from 1 to the number of tasks available which represents the task you wish to revert back to the
"incomplete" status. To view the index of the task you wish to unmark, use the `list` command. (See also: `list`)

#### Example of usage:

`unmark 1`
