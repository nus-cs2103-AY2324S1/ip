# Luke User Guide 
##### for v0.2.0-limited-release

**~Luke~** is a chatbot built upon the basic template of Duke, 
with a **CLI** (*Command Line Interface*) design. The chatbot is
designed to help manage tasks in an easy-to-use format.

## Features 

### Add tasks to a list
Luke saves lists to a file, allowing you to carry over information
across different sessions.

### Categorize and mark tasks
Luke allows you to use different types of tasks to manage them better, or
mark them to indicate completion.
### User-friendly
Luke provides **help interfaces** to guide new users, and allows 
**rebinding of commands** for advanced users who want
to save keystrokes when typing.

## Quickstart
### To use:
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest duke.jar release. (Check that the user guide is also of the same version!)

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Luke chatbot.
4. Double-click to start the bot!
### On startup:
The bot will on startup create a folder named `data` in the directory 
that the .jar file is placed in, to save tasks to a file.
Thereafter, the bot will display a short introductory message and show its logo.

## Usage

Tasks all have an associated name, and a complete/incomplete status.
