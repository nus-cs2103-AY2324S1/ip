## Quick Start

Oreo v1.0.1 is available for download [here](https://github.com/dloh2236/ip/releases/tag/A-Releasev1.0.1).

### System Pre-requisites

Make sure your system is running on Java 11, as this might affect your experience while using the chatbot.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è**IMPORTANT**  
> For Mac users who are unable to run the JAR file, you will have to install Azul build of Open JDK 11 version
> choose `JDK FX` version. The download link can be found 
> [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk-fx).

### Starting up Oreo

Simply put `oreo.jar` into your desired folder, open your terminal in that folder and enter:
`java -jar oreo.jar` and Oreo would be up and running to assist you!

> üè∑ **NOTE**  
> Oreo will create a data storage file "oreo.txt" where all your tasks will be saved in
> the program's own format. To ensure that your task is saved properly for your next run,
> please do not tamper or move the file from its current location.

You are all set! Start by saying `hi` to Oreo.

> **If Oreo Fails to Start!**
> 
> Try these:
> 1. Make sure you are running Java 11.
> 1. If you are a Mac user see [System Pre-requisites](#system-pre-requisites).
> 1. Delete "oreo.txt" file if it exists in the same directory. The file is unfortunately corrupted.
> 1. Move `oreo.jar` to another folder and try again.

## Key Features

Here are some of the key features that Oreo has!

### Help (`help`, `help <COMMAND>`)

#### Help Commands

Provides in-app help, through in-app guides, to get you started in the app.

###### Format:

`help` - provides a list of all the commands and a brief description of what they do.

`help <COMMAND>` - provides a detailed description of the specified `<COMMAND>`, use this to learn more about the command and
it's proper syntax.

###### Example Usage:

|    Command    | What it does                                                                                            |

###### Format:

`deadline <DESCRIPTION> /by <DATETIME>` - creates a deadline task with a description and "/by" a date time specified.

> üè∑ **NOTE**  
> 1. If there is both date and time input, both will be saved accordingly. This is the recommended way to save past deadlines or else oreo will assume either the date or the year of the date time input. See [Date Time Assumptions](#date-time-assumptions).
> 1. If there is a date-only input, time will not be included in the saved task.
> 1. If there is a time-only input, the date will be set to the next occurrence of the time.

If this is too confusing, just do what makes sense!

###### General Rules:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. If `/from` or `/to` has a time, both **must** have a time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. `/to` must be after `/from`.

> üè∑ **NOTE**  
> 1. Only date input will not include a time saved in the task.
> 1. Only time input will set a date with reference to the `/to` time and give the next occurrence of that duration.
> 1. For `time` to `date, time`  input, the inferred date for `/from` will be the next occurrence of that time instead of
> referencing the `/to` time.

> They all follow the same syntax and have the same functions, `update`, and `modify` are just aliases for `edit`.

Opens editing mode for the task specified by the index. The task specified will appear in the text field for the user to modify. Modified tasks must follow the correct syntax of adding a task.

Users can type `C` or `c` to exit editing mode for the task and resume normal mode.

the same position in the list as the old task.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è**IMPORTANT**  
> After entering editing mode, you will realise a change in GUI to reflect the change in mode. As such, only adding task
> commands and `c` will do anything. Any other command will prompt the user to edit the previously selected task. To
> exit, type `c`.

### Marking and Unmarking Task (`mark`, `unmark`)

#### Mark Command and Unmark Command

> üè∑ **NOTE**

>`bye` ignores any other input after the command. However, appending any characters to bye will be invalid and an
> unrecognised command.

### Miscellaneous

#### `Hello` / `hi`

This input is not a command! Rather we have recognised that first-time users are likely to type this input when they
first start using the app. Hence, greeting Oreo prompts her to greet you back and offer assistance. 

Do say hello to Oreo!

#### Other features
There are some hidden features in Oreo that we won't tell you! Play around with her a while more to find these hidden
easter eggs we have planted in the app! 

## Date Time Formats
One of the features of Oreo is the extensive date time formats it accepts. However, due to the wide variety of date time
formats and combinations that Oreo accepts, there are certain rules that need to be followed. This is to ensure the date
time is recorded properly and for the users to input their desired date time easily.

###### Accepted Date Formats:

|    Format    | Examples                   | Remarks            |

###### Using Date and Time Together:
When using date and time together, you must separate the date and time with `,<space>`.

‚úÖ **A GOOD EXAMPLE**

```
1 Jan 2023, 6pm
```

You may use any combination of date and time formats when doing this, even within the same command.

```
event playtime /from 1 jan, 1800 /to 03/1, 10pm    // is valid as well
```

However, the purpose of accepting such varied date time formats is not for this use but to cater to varied
preference of date time formats. 

‚ùå **BAD EXAMPLES**

```
1 /0  1/2023, 43pm    // not valid date and time, unecessary whitespaces
1 Jan 2023 6pm        // valid date and time but missing comma
```

##### Date Time Assumptions

Oreo allows input of date-only and time-only commands when adding deadlines and events. Data inputs may or may not include a year. As such, there are certain underlying assumptions that Oreo will make based on the entered-in date time. Understanding this would enable you to use the date time expansive date time format effectively.

##### Time-Only Inputs

Oreo will set the date of the task to the next occurrence of the input time. We have implemented it in such as way because
Oreo is a chat bot that keeps track of future tasks for you. Hence, an input without a date would assume that you are
adding the task for the future.

> ### For example:
> 
> **Assume the date and time now is 1st January 2023, 12pm.**
>
> ```
> deadline give oreo breakfast /by 9am // deadline will be set for 2nd January 2023, 9am.
> deadline give oreo dinner /by 6pm //deadline will be set for 1st January 2023, 6pm.
> ```
>
>> üè∑ **NOTE**    
> There is a **special** case for **event** tasks!
>
> **Assume the date and time now is 1st January 2023, 12pm.**
> ***from `time` to `time` inputs (Reference `/to` time - next occurrence of `/to` time)***
> 
> **Case 1:** ***from `time` to `time` inputs (Reference `/to` time - next occurrence of `/to` time)***
> 
> ```
> event playtime /from 11am /to 3pm //event will be set for 1st January 2023, 11-3pm
> event bathe /from 9am /to 9:30am //event will be set for 2nd January 2023, 11-3pm
> ```
> 
> **Case 2:** ***from `date` `time` to `time` (Reference `/from` date)***
> 
> ```
> event playtime /from 1 Jan, 11am /to 3pm // event will be set for 1st January 2023, 11-3pm
> ```
> 
> **Case 3:** ***from `time` to `date` `time` (Reference `/from` time)***
> 
> ```
> event oreo's special days /from 9am /to 31 Dec, 11:59pm // event will be set for 2nd Jan 2023, 9am to 31st Dec 11:59pm
> ```

For more information about event date time formats, see [Using Date and Time in Events](#using-date-and-time-in-events).

##### Date-Only Inputs

In this case, Oreo will assume these are whole-day tasks and will not set a time for these tasks hence, only the date is
saved.

##### Date Without Year Inputs

This is where things get tricky! Similar to time-only inputs, Oreo will set the year of the date to the next occurrence
of the date or next occurrence of the date specified in `/to` for events.

> ### For example:
>
> **Assume the date and time now is 1st January 2023**
>
> ```
> deadline new years' eve /by 31 Dec // deadline will be set for 31st December 2024.
> event christmas /from 25 Dec /to 5 Jan // the event will be set for 25th December 2022 to 5th January 2023.
> event playtime /from 9am /to 1st Jan, 5pm // INVALID! As 9am will be read independently and be assumed to be on 2nd January.
> ```

##### Using Date and Time in Events

You should have realised that date time for events can be quite tricky due to the permutations of date time that are
possible. There are **9** to be exact. Due to this, we have to limit these permutations that make sense. Otherwise, Oreo would be confused
as to what date and time to set. 

You can read [here](#event-tasks) to see the combinations and learn more about the event task,
or you can see it below with more additional information:

|    `/from`     | `/to`        |
|:--------------:|:------------:|
|  `date, time`  | `date, time` |
|  `date, time`  | `time`       |
|     `date`     | `date`       |
|     `time`     | `time`       |
|     `time`     | `date, time` |

If this is too confusing, just do what makes sense!

**General Rules**:

1. If `/from` or `/to` have a time, both **must** have a time.
1. `/to` **must** be after `/from`.

**Easy Formatting:**

For ease of inputting date time for same-day events. We have negated the requirement of requiring a date in `/to` if a
date is specified in `/from`. Oreo will take the date specified in `/from` and apply it to the date time in '/to'. We did this as we would usually present events as such: *Dinner on 1st January, 6 - 8pm*.

Example of how it looks like when adding such an event:

```
event Dinner /from 1 Jan, 6pm /to 8pm
```

This also helps reduce the redundancy of commands.

> üè∑ **NOTE**  
> #### Additional Notes:
> 
>- Only date input will not include a time saved in the task.
>- Only time input will set a date with reference to the `/to` time and give the next occurrence of that duration.
>- For `time` to `date, time`  input, the inferred date for `/from` will be the next occurrence of that time instead of 
>referencing the `/to` time.
