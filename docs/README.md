# User Guide
### Skye: Task Management Chatbot
Skye is **desktop app for managing tasks**. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Skye can manage your tasks faster than other GUI apps.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest release of `skye.jar` from [here](https://github.com/ktzy0305/ip/releases/). 
3. Copy `skye.jar` to an empty folder that you want to use as the home folder for your task management.
4. You can either double-click on `skye.jar` or open a terminal and type `java -jar skye.jar` to run the application. A window should appear in a few seconds with a welcome message as shown below.
