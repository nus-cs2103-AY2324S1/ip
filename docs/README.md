6. Type the command into the input field located next to the send button and press Enter to execute it. E.g. Typing `list` and pressing Enter will list all the tasks you have created so far. <br><br> Some example commands you can try:

    - `todo read a book` : Adds a Todo task that contains "read a book" as its description.
    - `mark 1` : Marks the 1st task on your list as done.
    - `delete 1` : Deletes the 1st task on your list.
    - `find read` : Finds any tasks whose description contains "read".
    - `bye` : Exits the application.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

> **Note**
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters you supply
> - For certain commands such as `todo`, parameters are supplied after special delimiters. E.g. `/by`, `/from`, `/to`.
> - Extra parameters you supply to the commands will be ignored. E.g. `list 1` will ignore `1` and still execute as normal.

### Listing your tasks - `list`

  - `deadline watch CS2103T lecture /by Oct 20 2023 1800` - The task "watch CS2103T lecture" has to be completed by 20 Oct, 6pm.
  - `deadline watch CS2103T lecture /by 20/10/2023 1800` - Gives the same result as the command above.
