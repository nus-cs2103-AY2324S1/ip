## Adding Tasks

In Jarvis, there are three task types:

### 1. Todo Tasks

- Purpose: Basic tasks with no specific deadline.

### 2. Deadline Tasks

- Purpose: Tasks with specific due dates and times.

### 3. Event Tasks

- Purpose: Tasks representing events with start and end times.

Learn how manage these tasks using commands in the following.

---

## Adding a Todo task: `todo`

Adds a "Todo" task to the task list in the Jarvis app.

### Command Format: `todo TASK_DESCRIPTION`

- `TASK_DESCRIPTION`: The description of the "Todo" task you want to add.
- No other parameter is required, all information after `todo` command will be taken as `TASK_DESCRIPTION`

### Example:

`todo Buy groceries` will add a "Todo" task with the description "Buy groceries" to the task list.

```
Task:
1. T | 0 | Buy groceries
```

### Usage Tips:

- Use meaningful and descriptive text for the `TASK_DESCRIPTION` to easily identify the task.
- Do not include unnecessary details in `TASK_DESCRIPTION` eg. due date which can be added as other task
  type (`Deadline`).

---

## Adding a Deadline task: `deadline`

Adds a "Deadline" task to the task list in the Jarvis app.

### Command Format: `deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION by DUE_DATE`

- `TASK_DESCRIPTION`: The description of the "Deadline" task you want to add.
- `DUE_DATE`: The due date and time for the task in the format `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm`.

### Example:

`deadline Submit report by Sep 22 2023 1400` will add a "Deadline" task with the description "Submit report" and a due
date of "15th October 2023, 2:00 PM" to the task list.

```
Task:
1. D | 0 | Submit report | Sep 22 2023 1400
```

### Usage Tips:

- Ensure you provide a clear and descriptive `TASK_DESCRIPTION`.
- Remember to include the `by` keyword after `TASK_DESCRIPTION` and before `DUE_DATE`
- Use the acceptable format for `DUE_DATE` to avoid date and time format errors.
    - `MMM dd yyyy HHmm` eg. Sep 22 2023 1400
    - `dd MMM yyyy HHmm` eg. 22 Sep 2023 1400
    - `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` eg. 2023-08-22 1400
