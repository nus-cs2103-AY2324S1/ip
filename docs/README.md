## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Command words are case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. `list`, `List`, and `LIST` all are valid and refer to the same command.

* Words inside the `[]` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo [task]`, `[task]` is a parameter which can be used as `todo workout`.

* Parameter `[deadline]`, `[start]`, and `[end]` must be supplied in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.<br>
  e.g. `/by [deadline]` can be used as `/by 2023-09-22`

* Parameter `[time]` must be supplied in `[amount] [type]` where the `[amount]` must be an integer and the `[type]` must be equal to either `days`, `day`, `hours`, `hour`, `minutes`, `minute`, `seconds`, or `second`.<br>
  e.g. `/in [time]` can be used as `/in 3 hours`

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will result in error.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list whatever`, it will be interpreted as invalid command.

* The expected outcomes given in this user guide is based when the first example command of each features is executed with the same order as the user guide.
