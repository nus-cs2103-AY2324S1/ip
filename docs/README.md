### 3. Mark/Unmark Tasks as Done

#### 3.1. Mark Task as Done - `mark`

Once you have completed a task, you can tell Snake CYQJ to mark it as done.

Format:

```
mark <task number>
```

- `<task number>` is the number of the task in the list, as shown by the `list` command.

Example:

Suppose the task list as shown by the `list` command is as follows:

```
Here are the tasks in your list:
1.[T][] feed snake
```

Using the `mark` command:
```
mark 1
```

Expected Output:

```
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[T][X] feed snake
```

#### 3.2. Unmark Task as Done - `unmark`

If you have marked a task as done by mistake, you can tell Snake CYQJ to unmark it.

Format:

```
unmark <task number>
```

- `<task number>` is the number of the task in the list, as shown by the `list` command.

Example:

Suppose the task list as shown by the `list` command is as follows:

```
Here are the tasks in your list:
1.[T][X] feed snake
```

Using the `unmark` command:

```
unmark 1
```

Expected Output:

```
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
[T][] feed snake
```

### 4. Delete Tasks - `delete`

Snake CYQJ can help you delete tasks from your task list.

⚠️ Caution: Once a task is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

⚠️ Caution: Deleting a task will shift the task numbers of the tasks after it forward by 1.

- If you delete task 2, task 1 will remain as task 1, but task 3 will become task 2, task 4 will become task 3, and so on.

Format:

```
delete <task number>
```

- `<task number>` is the number of the task in the list, as shown by the `list` command.

Example:

Suppose the task list as shown by the `list` command is as follows:

```
Here are the tasks in your list:
1.[T][] feed snake
```

Using the `delete` command:
```
delete 1
```

Expected Output:

Noted. I've removed this task:
[T][] feed snake
Now you have 0 tasks in the list.
```

### 5. Find Tasks - `find`

Snake CYQJ can help you find tasks in your task list that has a certain keyword in its description.

Note: The numbering of tasks in the search result will be the same as the numbering of tasks as shown in the `list` command.

Format:

```
find <keyword>
```

- `<keyword>` is the keyword to search for in the task description.
    - The keyword cannot be empty.
    - The keyword is case-sensitive.
