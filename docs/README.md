# Chatty ðŸ‘¾

Chatty is a task management application, that allows you to keep track of you tasks. The 3 main tasks supported are ToDo, Deadlines and Events. Instructions will be given on how you can use Chatty:

## Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above stored in your computer
2. Download the latest `duke.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AlyssaPng/ip/releases/tag/A-Release)
3. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar duke.jar` command to run the application. The Chatty GUI should appear in a few seconds.
4. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.  e.g. typing `list` and pressing Enter will display all the tasks in the task list.
5. Here are some example commands:
   1. `todo read book`: Adds a ToDo task with the description: "read book".
   2. `deadline CS2103T project /by 2019-10-15 1800` : Adds a Deadline task with the description: "CS2103T IP" and due date: "Oct 15 2019 6:00pm"
   3. `list`: Displays all the tasks in the task list and their respective task index.
   4. `delete 1`: Removes the first task in the task list.
   5. `mark 3`: Marks the third task in the task list as done.
   6. `find project`: Displays the tasks which description contains the String "project".
   7. `bye`: Exits the application.

## Things to Note:
1. Chatty automatically saves your task list into a `./data/duke.txt` file which is updated everytime task list is changed.
   1. `./data/duke.txt` file is located in the same directory as your `duke.jar` file
2. Chatty will tell you if you have already added a task into you task list, preventing duplicates!
