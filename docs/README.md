## Features

### Intuitive user interface
The user interface is similar to the ones 
that can be found in many applications, so you'll feel right at home even as
a first time user. _Even IRIS' name is familiar_ :).

### Track your to-dos, deadlines, and events
IRIS will keep you up to date with your tasks that have no specified date, an due date,
or ones that occur over a duration.

### Duplicate task detection
Forgetful? Fear not, IRIS will remind you of duplicate tasks, easing the mental
exertion of remembering whether you've already added the task.
