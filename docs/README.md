**Ekud** is a simple chatbot that helps you remember your to-dos, deadlines and events.

## Features

* List all the tasks you currently have
* Mark tasks as done and unmark them as well
* Automatically saves tasks to a file and loads when the chatbot is opened

## Usage

2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ravern/ip/releases) of Ekud from GitHub
3. Run the JAR file using the command `java -jar Ekud.jar`
