# Zac

Zac is a very helpful chatbot that helps you plan your tasks. It's named after the Java mascot _Duke_. Given below are
instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project
   first)
1. Open the project into IntelliJ as follows:
    1. Click `Open`.
    1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
    1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained
   in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialogue, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
3. After that, locate the `src/main/java/duke/Launcher.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Launcher.main()` (if
   the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE).
