# User Guide

Bob is a Chatbot that can help free your mind of having to remember things you need to do! It helps you record down your todos, deadlines or events using a CLI within a custom GUI.

## Features
### Notes about the command format:
- Words within curly brackers `{}` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `todo {description}`, `{description}` is a parameter which can be used as add `todo do laundry`.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as list and bye) will be ignored.
e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

- Items with â€¦â€‹ after them can be used multiple times.
e.g. `mark {index}â€¦`â€‹ can be used as `mark 2 4 5`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
