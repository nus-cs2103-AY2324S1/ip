# Juke User Guide

Welcome to the `Juke` User Guide! Through this user guide, you will:

* Learn what `Juke` is and how it can help you track your tasks
* Learn the features of `Juke`
* Learn the commands that `Juke` can understand

Let's get started!

## Getting Started

As `Juke` is a GUI application, you will need to install the relevant Java GUI libraries on
your machine.

### Setting Up

To use `Juke`, you will need to install `Java 11` on your machine. You can find out more on
how you can install `Java 11` on your
[Windows machine](https://docs.azul.com/core/zulu-openjdk/install/windows),
[MacOS machine](https://docs.azul.com/core/zulu-openjdk/install/macos) or
[Linux machine](https://docs.azul.com/core/zulu-openjdk/install/debian) by clicking on the hyperlinked
text.

Ensure that you are downloading the latest version of `Java 11` from the websites that contain
the `JavaFX` library prepackaged in it.

> **⚠️Warning**  
> If you decide not to use the above `Java 11` JDKs for any reason, ensure that the JDK you
> decide to use is at least `Java 11` and you install the relevant `JavaFX` library along with
> the installation of the JDK!

Next, head to [this website](https://github.com/asdfghjkxd/ip/releases) and download the latest JAR file
attached in the latest release of `Juke`.

### Running `Juke`

Open up your device's terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the location where the JAR file is
downloaded into using the `cd` command. Click [here](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-cd-in-linux)
to learn more about the `cd` command.

Finally, run the command `java -jar juke.jar` to start `Juke`!

### Frequently Asked Questions

Encountered some issues with installing Java or running the JAR file? Here are some common questions you may have!

**Q: Which version of `Java` do I need to install? There's so many versions called `Java 11`!**

**A:** Any version of Java 11 will do! Ensure that the JDK you install comes bundled with the JavaFX 
library! If you are using the Zulu JDK above, ensure that you install the ones that are tagged with 
"JDK FX" on the downloads page!


**Q: I have downloaded the JAR file, but I can't seem to execute the file!**

**A:** Do check that the correct Java version is being referenced when you execute the command 
"java -jar juke.jar", if you are unsure, run the command "java --version" to view the current 
version of Java that is used to execute the JAR file!

To change the default version of Java on your PC, check out <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux">this guide</a>  
to find out more on how you can set your PC's "JAVA_HOME" variable to allow the command to properly 
reference the Java 11 version you installed!

## Features

`Juke` is packed full of features to help you track your tasks!

### Add a `Todo` Task

You can add a `Todo` Task to help you track the tasks that you need to do! `Todo` tasks have
no deadlines, and are represented only by their completion status!

#### Usage

`todo [task name]`

> **⚠️Warning**  
> The task name you enter **cannot** just be one or more spaces (" ")!

#### Examples

* `todo task`
* `todo this is also a valid task`
* `todo task 1 is also a valid task`

#### Expected Outcome

If successful, `Juke` will respond with:

```
Task added: [T] [] <YOUR TASK NAME>
```

#### Possible Errors

The following are examples of errors that could happen to the `todo` command:

* `todo`: When the task name is omitted, an error will occur

---

### Add a `Deadline` Task

Create a `Deadline` Task to track completable tasks with a deadline!

#### Usage

`deadline [task name] /by [(DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY HH(: or -)MM) OR (DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY)]`

* Note the following
  * `DD`: 2-digit number representing the day
  * `MM`: 2-digit number representing the month
  * `YYYY`: 4-digit number representing the year
  * `HH`: 2-digit number representing the hour in 24 hours
  * `MM`: 2-digit number representing the minutes

> **⚠️Warning**  
> The task name you enter **cannot** just be one or more spaces (" ")!

#### Examples

* `deadline task /by 01/01/2023 23:59`
* `deadline other valid task /by 01/01/2023`

#### Expected Outcome

If successful, `Juke` will respond with:

```
Task added: [D] [] <YOUR TASK NAME> by: <TASK DEADLINE>
```

#### Possible Errors

The following are examples of errors that could happen to the `deadline` command:

* `deadline`, `deadline /by`: When the arguments are omitted, an error will occur
* `deadline error task /by gibberish`: When the date argument is invalid, an error will occur

---

### Create an `Event` Task

Create `Event` Tasks to track completable tasks with start and end dates!

#### Usage

```
event [task name] /from [(DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY HH(: or -)MM) OR (DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY)]
/to [(DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY HH(: or -)MM) OR (DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY)]
```

* Note the following
  * `DD`: 2-digit number representing the day
  * `MM`: 2-digit number representing the month
  * `YYYY`: 4-digit number representing the year
  * `HH`: 2-digit number representing the hour in 24 hours
  * `MM`: 2-digit number representing the minutes

> **ℹ️ Note**  
> The date formats used in `event` follows closely to what `deadline` uses!

> **⚠️Warning**  
> The task name you enter **cannot** just be one or more spaces (" ")!

#### Examples

* `event task /from 01/01/2023 23:59 /to 01/01/2024 23:59`
* `event other valid task /from 01/01/2023 /to 01/01/2024 23:59`

#### Expected Outcome

If successful, `Juke` will respond with:

```
Task added: [E] [] <YOUR TASK NAME> (from <TASK START DATE> to <TASK END DATE>)
```

#### Possible Errors

The following are examples of errors that could happen to the `event` command:

* `event`, `event /from`, `event /from /to`: When the arguments are omitted, an error will occur
* `event error task /from gibberish /to gibberish 2`: When the date argument is invalid, an error will occur
* `event error task 2 /from 01/01/2023 /to 01/01/2000`: When the start date is before the end date, an error will occur

---

### Mark a Task as Done

You can mark a Task as complete to help you track your incomplete tasks!

#### Usage

```
mark [TASK INDEX]
```
