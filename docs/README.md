3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AddressBook.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar ``alpha.jar``
command to run the application.

**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.


* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### deleting a task: ``delete``

Deletes the task at the specified index in the task list.

Format: ``delete INDEX``
- Deletes the person at the specified index.
- The index must be positive and must refer to a task in the displayed list.
- If you need to check which task is at which index, please use ``list``.

Examples:
- ``list`` followed by ``delete 2`` deletes the 2nd person in the task list.

### Marking a task: ``mark``

Marks a task at the specified index in the task list.

Format: ``mark INDEX``
- Marks the task at the specified index.
- The index must be positive and must refer to a task in the displayed list.
- If you need to check which task is at which index, please use ``list``.
- If the task at the specified index is already marked, this command does nothing.

Examples:
- ``list`` followed by ``mark 4`` marks the 2nd task in the task list.

### Unmarking a task: ``unmark``

Format: ``unmark INDEX``
- Unmarks the task at the specified index.
- The index must be positive and must refer to a task in the displayed list.
- If you need to check which task is at which index, please use ``list``.
- If the task at the specified index is already unmarked, this command does nothing.

Examples:
- ``list`` followed by ``unmark 3`` unmarks the 2nd task in the task list.

### Finding a task: ``find``

Format: ``find ``
Finds tasks with descriptions that contain a keyword.

Format: ``find KEYWORD``
- This keyword is case-insensitive. e.g. ``meeting`` will match with ``Meeting``.
- The tasks are displayed based on their order within the task list.
- Only the description of tasks is searched.
- Sub-words wil be matched e.g. ``cut`` will match with ``cute``.
- The indices displayed in the find list are cosmetic. Do not use these indices in your ``delete``, ``mark`` or ``unmark`` commands. Use the indices from ``list`` instead.

Examples:
- ``find meeting`` finds all task descriptions with the word ``meeting`` in them.
- ``find a`` finds all task descriptions with at least one instance of the letter `a`.


### Saving the data

Task list data is automatically stored on the hard disk in the program itself.
