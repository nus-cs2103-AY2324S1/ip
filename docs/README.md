# Gman Chatbot User Guide

## Features 

### Add and remove tasks

Add tasks such as a todo, deadline or an event. Delete tasks by index.

### Mark and unmark tasks as done/undone

All tasks can be marked. Marked tasks will be indicated with [X] and unmarked tasks will be indicated with [ ].

### Save and read tasks for future usage

When done with managing tasks, simply say bye and the Gman Chatbot will save your task list that can be opened again in 
the future.

### List out tasks
List out all tasks in the task list in a numbered list, starting from most recently added at  1.

### Find tasks with a specific keyword
Same as listing out tasks, but only those that contain a user specified keyword.


## Usage

### `todo` - Adds a todo task to the task list. Has to be followed up with a String.
A todo task consists of one field: description.

\

\
A todo with the description of task is added to the task list.

Expected Output from GUI:
```

```

### `deadline` - Adds a deadline task to the task list. Has to be followed up with a String.

A deadline task consists of two fields: description and by. The fields are separated by the user through the use of 
"/by".
\
The by field should be in the form of a date in the format yyyy-mm-dd.

Example of usage:
\
`deadline Submit CS2100 Assignment /by 2023-09-10`

```

### `event` - Adds an event task to the task list. Has to be followed up with a String.

An event task consists of three fields: description, from, & to. The fields are separated by the user through the 
use of
"/from" & "/to".
\
There is no constraint on the format of from & to.

Example of usage:
\
`event Sheares Hall Marathon Training /from Monday /to Wednesday`

Expected outcome:
\
An event task with the description, from, & to is added to the task list.

```

### `list` - Lists out all tasks in the task list. Should not be followed up with anything.

Lists out the tasks to the user in a numbered format. Tasks are listed from the earliest task added.

Example of usage:
\
`list`

Expected outcome:
\
A numbered list of all tasks in the task list is output to the user in the GUI. Assuming we have added all three 
tasks from before in the order of task, deadline, then event:

### `mark` - Mark a task in the task list as done. Should be followed up with an integer.

Marks a task in the task list at given index as done. Index given should not be 0 or an integer greater than the 
size of the task list (i.e. the index should at most be the number of tasks in the task list).

Example of usage:
\
`mark 1`

Expected outcome:
\
The first task is now marked as done. This is shown to the user with a [X] checkbox.

```
Nice! I've marked this task as done:

```

### `unmark` - Un-mark a task in the task list as undone. Should be followed up with an integer.
Un-marks a task in the task list at given index as undone. Index given should not be 0 or an integer greater than the
size of the task list (i.e. the index should at most be the number of tasks in the task list).


Example of usage:

`unmark 1`

Expected outcome:

The first task that was just previously marked as done is now un-marked as undone. This is shown to the user with an 
empty [ ] checkbox.

Expected Output from GUI:
```
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
[T][ ] Get a haircut
```

### `delete` - Deletes a task in the task list. Should be followed up with an integer.
Deletes a task in the task list at given index. Index given should not be 0 or an integer greater than the size of 
the task list (i.e. the index should at most be the number of tasks in the task list).


Example of usage:
\
`delete 3`

Expected outcome:
\
The task at the specified index is removed from the task list. GUI outputs to user the task that has been deleted, 
along with the number of tasks left in the list.

Noted. I've removed this task:
