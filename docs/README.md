‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes about the command format:

- Words enclosed in `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  - e.g. In `todo <description>`, `<description>` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.

- Items in square brackets `[]` are optional.
  - e.g. In `edit <task number> [/d <description>] [/b <deadline>]`, the `/d` and `/b` parameters are optional.
  - You can choose to include either one, both, or none of them.

- Parameters must strictly be in the order specified, unless otherwise stated.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.
  - e.g. If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

```

#### 4.3. Edit Event task

### 5. Delete Tasks - `delete`

Max can help you delete tasks from your task list.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Once a task is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Deleting a task will shift the task numbers of the tasks after it forward by 1. 
    
- If you delete task 2, task 1 will remain as task 1, but task 3 will become task 2, task 4 will become task 3, and so on.

Format:

delete <task number>
```

- `<task number>` is the number of the task in the list, as shown by the `list` command.

```
delete 1
