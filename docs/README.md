## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer
2. Download the latest `koko.jar` from [here]() to your computer
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Koko

> Note that the file will create a `data` folder in the same directory it is in, which will store the Task List

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it

> e.g. typing `list` and pressing Enter will list all the tasks in your task list.

## Data Storage

Koko stores the task list in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the task list. There is no need to save manually.

This is saved in the `data` folder created in the same directory as the `koko.jar` file. If no such folder exists, Koko will create one.
