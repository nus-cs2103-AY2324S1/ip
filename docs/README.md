# User Guide

Je-O Chatbot is a desktop app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest jeo.jar from here.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Je-O Chatbot.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.  
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.
